# Nightmare-Client
Hello! This is Nightmare Hack Client for version 1.8.
I am new to Java so go easy on me.
Theres much more to come and this client and its quite half baked right now.
No CLICKGUI or anything of the sorts so heres the keybind list
L -JumpFly 
P -FullBright
B -KillAura
N -NoFall
K -Fly
R -Sprint
Install instructions included.
This client works well on BlocksMC and extrordinary on HonlyCraft.
(NoFall patched on BlocksMC, Fly/JumpFly wont kick as long as u arent retarded, and KA rarely kicks but it occsionally happens.)
The client is unobfuscated so you can check for anything sus if u want, or if you wanna skid.
I'll try to update once every like 3 months at the least until I would rather jump off a cliff than code another update.
Thanks and I hope you have fun :)
